# Computation math task 2

- **LU factorization** with _partial pivoting_: I swap only columns when I try build diagonally prevalent form of matrix. LU decomposition is used for calculating **inverse matrix**, **determinant**, **solve SLAE**, **conditional number** (as we need to calculate inverse matrix), catching **incompatible SLAEs**

- **QR factorization** for and **SLAE solving**

- **Jacobi** method & **Seidel** method with a prior and a posterior measures for diagonally prevalent matrixes (which is build with utility method)
